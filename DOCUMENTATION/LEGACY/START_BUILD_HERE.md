## 🚀 The Building Process (3-4 Weeks)

### Week 1: Game Engine Foundation
- Day 1-2: Setup environment (npm, Vite, dependencies)
- Day 3-4: Build GameScene.js (main game container)
- Day 5: Build PlayerController.js (movement)
- **By end:** Player can move around

### Week 2: Game Systems
- Day 1-2: Build NPCSystem.js (NPC behavior)
- Day 3: Build MapManager.js (level management)
- Day 4: Build Camera & Collision managers
- Day 5: Full integration test
- **By end:** NPC interaction works, game pauses, UI shows

### Week 3: Content & Polish
- Day 1-2: Create data files (NPC, map, quest data)
- Day 3: Verify all quests work
- Day 4-5: Add animations, audio, polish
- **By end:** Complete playable game

## 💡 Why This Architecture Works

### Simple Structure
- **6 Phaser systems**, each with ONE responsibility
- **8 React components**, already built and styled
- **1 event bus**, handles all communication
- **No complex state management**, just local state

### Clear Separation
- Phaser = Game logic only
- React = UI only
- Event bus = Communication only
- Each layer works independently

### Easy to Test
- Test Phaser systems separately
- Test React components with component-test.html
- Test integration by playing the game
- Debug events in browser console

### Scalable Foundation
- Can add more NPCs easily
- Can add more quests easily
- Can add new maps easily
- Database integration is straightforward

## 🎮 How the Game Flows (User Experience)

```
Player starts game
    ↓
Player uses WASD to walk around
    ↓
Player approaches NPC
    ↓
NPC gets highlighted (yellow tint)
    ↓
Player presses E key
    ↓
Screen fades, dialog box appears
    ↓
NPC says "Welcome, adventurer!"
    ↓
Player clicks "Continue"
    ↓
Dialog closes, quest popup appears
    ↓
Player reads lesson content
    ↓
Player clicks "Start Quiz"
    ↓
Quiz shows question

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **One File, One Job**
   - GameScene.js = main container
   - PlayerController.js = just movement
   - NPCSystem.js = just NPC behavior
   - Easy to understand and debug

2. **Event-Driven Design**
   - Phaser emits, React listens
   - React emits, Phaser listens
   - Complete decoupling
   - No hard dependencies

3. **Data-Driven Configuration**
   - NPC definitions in npcData.js
   - Map definitions in mapData.js
   - Quest definitions in questsData.js
   - Easy to modify without changing code

4. **Test Early and Often**
   - Test GameScene renders
   - Test player movement
   - Test NPC interaction
   - Test UI displays
   - Test full flow

## 📞 Quick Answers

**Q: Which file do I read first?**  
A: ARCHITECTURE/README.md

**Q: Which file has code I can copy?**  
A: ARCHITECTURE/02-PHASER-LAYER/PHASER_ARCHITECTURE.md

**Q: Do I need to read all 200 KB of docs?**  
A: No! You can skim. QUICK_REFERENCE.md has the essentials.

**Q: Can I start before reading everything?**  
A: Yes! Read README.md, then start coding. Reference others as needed.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Check QUICK_REFERENCE.md or the relevant architecture guide.

**Q: Can I test without backend?**  
A: Yes! The event system is in-browser. Test everything locally first.
