## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't skip documentation**
   - Read each phase guide before starting
   - Understand what you're building before coding

2. **Test after each step**
   - Don't wait until end of phase
   - Test as you go

3. **Keep console open**
   - Press F12 in browser
   - Watch for errors in real-time

4. **Commit progress**
   - Use git to save milestones
   - `git commit -m "Phase 2.1 complete"`

5. **Take breaks**
   - Fresh eyes catch bugs
   - Don't code for 8 hours straight
